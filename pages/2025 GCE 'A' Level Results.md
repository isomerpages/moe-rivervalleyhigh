<p>Congratulations to the Class of 2025! Our students have continued to do
well! As RV celebrates 70 years of excellence this year, we are reminded
that our legacy extends far beyond academic achievements to encompass the
holistic development of every student. Today, we celebrate their all-round
achievements; their success reflects not only their dedication to learning
but also their personal growth to become leaders of distinction. We would
like to express our heartfelt appreciation to the School Leaders, staff
members, School Advisory Committee, Alumni, Parent-Teacher Association,
and the families who have supported our graduates throughout their journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As our graduates embark on their next chapter, they are poised to
shape their own destinies while inspiring their juniors and creating meaningful
legacies. Many have already begun this journey through their remarkable
contributions to our school and the wider community, demonstrating the
impact they can make when they apply their talents, skills, and values
to serve others. We are proud to highlight some of these outstanding graduates.</p>
