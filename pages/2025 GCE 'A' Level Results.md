<p>Congratulations to the Class of 2025! Our students have continued to do
well! As RV celebrates 70 years of excellence this year, we are reminded
that our legacy extends far beyond academic achievements to encompass the
holistic development of every student. Today, we celebrate their all-round
achievements; their success reflects not only their dedication to learning
but also their personal growth to become leaders of distinction. We would
like to express our heartfelt appreciation to the School Leaders, staff
members, School Advisory Committee, Alumni, Parent-Teacher Association,
and the families who have supported our graduates throughout their journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As our graduates embark on their next chapter, they are poised to
shape their own destinies while inspiring their juniors and creating meaningful
legacies. Many have already begun this journey through their remarkable
contributions to our school and the wider community, demonstrating the
impact they can make when they apply their talents, skills, and values
to serve others. We are proud to highlight some of these outstanding graduates.</p>

<p>Shen Han's passion for wildlife conservation led him to explore sustainable
food solutions through the MOE Science Mentorship Programme. He helped
researchers at the Singapore University of Technology and Design develop
3D-printed food products with cricket powder as a sustainable alternative,
which later won him first prize at the Shanghai International Youth Science
and Technology Camp.
<br>
</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, Shen Han independently secured research opportunities
at the National University of Singapore. With guidance from Associate Professor
Ryan Chisholm, he conducted literature reviews on endangered bird species
during JC1 GAP Month. After this stint, he worked under Associate Professor
Frank Rheindt, where he proposed a novel colourimetric method to study
avian taxonomy until the end of JC2. His comprehensive report earned first
authorship in an article published in <em>Avian Research</em>, a Gold Award
at the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, and selection as one of
six projects representing Singapore at the International Science and Engineering
Fair in Ohio, USA. He also volunteered with the Worldwide Fund for Nature,
contributing to butterfly counts and habitat impact studies, reflecting
his commitment to conservation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A finalist in the People of Good (Student) category at the President's
Volunteerism &amp; Philanthropy Awards 2025 and as Vice-President of the
school's Service and Citizenship Society, Hayley has made significant contributions
to the community, having organised meaningful events for children with
special needs and weekly volunteer activities at senior homes. Being an
active grassroots leader, member of the People's Association Youth Movement,
and leader of the Animal Welfare Cluster in the Boon Lay Youth Network,
Hayley champions responsible pet ownership by organising monthly learning
journeys for children and leading efforts in reducing pet abandonment and
abuse through the Catwalk programme, connecting community cat feeders and
owners with relevant agencies for support.
<br>
<br>As Vice-Chairperson of the Boon Lay Countdown in 2024, Hayley collaborated
with community partners to put together a successful event. Leading the
Stage and Media Committee, her digital design expertise was instrumental
in creating engaging social media content, resulting in a large turnout
at the event. Her strong leadership and dedication to community service
is an example of a Leader of Distinction who is purposeful and does good.</p>
