<p>James is a promising young scientist who has a strong passion for Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This can be seen from
his active involvement in various workshops and enrichment programmes,
including the Young Defence Scientists Programme (YDSP) World of Science
modules in Computer Security and Quantum Technologies, YDSP Enrichment
Workshops, and the SWIFT Accelerator Programme. As the President of the
school’s Science Leaders Academy (SLA), James was committed to promoting
STEM education when planning the inaugural RV STEM Festival 2024 and fostering
strong bonds within the academy. A pivotal moment in James's journey was
his YDSP experience at the DSO National Laboratories. Here, he researched
on artificial intelligence, chatbots, and the security of large language
models. This project was particularly significant as it allowed James and
his twin brother, David, to explore uncharted territory in research. They
traversed the entire research cycle, from hypothesis formulation to data
analysis and conclusion drawing, gaining invaluable insights into the differences
between practical skills and research methodologies. His strong interest
in cybersecurity is evident from his role as Vice President of the school’s
Capture-The-Flag (CTF), where he planned training sessions and achieved
impressive rankings in cybersecurity competitions. In his free time, he
attended online courses such as Harvard's cybersecurity and TryHackMe.
He also actively participated in competitions with the locally founded
"Singapore Students Merger Team", co-founded by David. This team participates
in Capture-The-Flag (CTF) cybersecurity competitions, fostering a community
of learning and skill development. It swiftly rose to prominence, becoming
one of the top teams in Singapore. James played a crucial role in recruiting
new members, organising training sessions, and promoting events within
their networks. As James continues his journey in STEM, he stands as an
inspiration to his peers and juniors alike. His story is one of relentless
pursuit of knowledge, unwavering dedication to innovation, and a deep-seated
desire to make a positive impact on the world through STEM.</p>

</div>
<p>David demonstrates an exceptional aptitude for technology, evident in
his founding of the "Singapore Students Merger Team". This team participates
in Capture-The-Flag (CTF) cybersecurity competitions, fostering a community
of learning and skill development. Comprising highly skilled student participants,
it swiftly rose to become one of Singapore's top competition teams. David’s
innovative approaches to team building, skill development, and outreach
efforts reflect his commitment to nurturing Singapore's young cybersecurity
talent. His prowess and efforts are further evidenced by his victory in
the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore’s Advanced Youth Cyber Exploration
Programme 2023 and his leadership of the school team to emerge as champions
in the international OS CTF 2024 competition. Internships at the Ministry
of Home Affairs and DSO National Laboratories, coupled with his DSTA Junior
College Scholarship, further underscore his passion and potential in the
field of cybersecurity. David’s leadership skills shine through in his
various roles: Vice President of the Mathematics Leaders Academy, Director
of the school’s inaugural STEM Fest, Vice President of the school’s Chess
Club, and EXCO member of Infocomm Club. His leadership abilities and active

<summary>Koh Le Bon (23J09)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">

<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 GCE A Level /Koh_Le_Bon_optimized.png">
</div>
<p>As a Wushu athlete in the national team, Koh Le Bon exemplifies the pinnacle
of dedication, skill, and discipline. His stellar performance earned him
top honours in two events at the National School Games of 2023 and a silver
medal in the Qiangshu category at the International Wushu Invitational
Tournament 2024 in Jiangsu, China. Le Bon’s wushu journey was not without
its setbacks. In J1, he had an injury which prevented him from training
for the Asian Wushu Junior trials. Although he was disappointed at having
missed a golden opportunity, he chose to focus on his recovery, working
diligently with his physiotherapist and coaches rather than dwelling on
the missed trials. As Le Bon was gearing up to represent Singapore in the
Asian Wushu Championships in September 2024, an untimely injury compelled
him to withdraw from the competition. This was frustrating for him but
he recognised that the situation was largely beyond his control and chose
to redirect his energy towards his A-Level preparation, viewing this as
the most constructive way to move forward. Beyond competitions, Le Bon
was so passionate about wushu that he volunteered to perform and choreograph
wushu routines for Chingay when he was in J1. In the following year, he
took on the challenge of leading and teaching children aged 12 and below
to perform. This was no mean feat as he had to choreograph routines that
were manageable for the young performers, many of whom lacked a strong
wushu foundation. He also had to constantly adapt and finetune the choreography
to accommodate Chingay’s evolving artistic vision. Le Bon's remarkable
journey culminated in his nomination as the school's valedictorian, a testament
to his all-round achievements and the impact he has made on his school
community. His story is truly inspiring, demonstrating how the application
of adaptability and resilience helped him overcome all odds.</p>
