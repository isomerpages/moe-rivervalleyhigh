<p><strong><u>Chan Xing Yu, James (23J13)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>James is a promising young scientist who has a strong passion for Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This can be seen from
his active involvement in various workshops and enrichment programmes,
including the Young Defence Scientists Programme (YDSP) World of Science
modules in Computer Security and Quantum Technologies, YDSP Enrichment
Workshops, and the SWIFT Accelerator Programme. As the President of the
school’s Science Leaders Academy (SLA), James was committed to promoting
STEM education when planning the inaugural RV STEM Festival 2024 and fostering
strong bonds within the academy. A pivotal moment in James's journey was
his YDSP experience at the DSO National Laboratories. Here, he researched
on artificial intelligence, chatbots, and the security of large language
models. This project was particularly significant as it allowed James and
his twin brother, David, to explore uncharted territory in research. They
traversed the entire research cycle, from hypothesis formulation to data
analysis and conclusion drawing, gaining invaluable insights into the differences
between practical skills and research methodologies. His strong interest
in cybersecurity is evident from his role as Vice President of the school’s
Capture-The-Flag (CTF), where he planned training sessions and achieved
impressive rankings in cybersecurity competitions. In his free time, he
attended online courses such as Harvard's cybersecurity and TryHackMe.
He also actively participated in competitions with the locally founded
"Singapore Students Merger Team", co-founded by David. This team participates
in Capture-The-Flag (CTF) cybersecurity competitions, fostering a community
of learning and skill development. It swiftly rose to prominence, becoming
one of the top teams in Singapore. James played a crucial role in recruiting
new members, organising training sessions, and promoting events within
their networks. As James continues his journey in STEM, he stands as an
inspiration to his peers and juniors alike. His story is one of relentless
pursuit of knowledge, unwavering dedication to innovation, and a deep-seated
desire to make a positive impact on the world through STEM.</p>
