<p>As a Wushu athlete in the national team, Koh Le Bon exemplifies the pinnacle
of dedication, skill, and discipline. His stellar performance earned him
top honours in two events at the National School Games of 2023 and a silver
medal in the Qiangshu category at the International Wushu Invitational
Tournament 2024 in Jiangsu, China. Le Bon’s wushu journey was not without
its setbacks. In J1, he had an injury which prevented him from training
for the Asian Wushu Junior trials. Although he was disappointed at having
missed a golden opportunity, he chose to focus on his recovery, working
diligently with his physiotherapist and coaches rather than dwelling on
the missed trials. As Le Bon was gearing up to represent Singapore in the
Asian Wushu Championships in September 2024, an untimely injury compelled
him to withdraw from the competition. This was frustrating for him but
he recognised that the situation was largely beyond his control and chose
to redirect his energy towards his A-Level preparation, viewing this as
the most constructive way to move forward. Beyond competitions, Le Bon
was so passionate about wushu that he volunteered to perform and choreograph
wushu routines for Chingay when he was in J1. In the following year, he
took on the challenge of leading and teaching children aged 12 and below
to perform. This was no mean feat as he had to choreograph routines that
were manageable for the young performers, many of whom lacked a strong
wushu foundation. He also had to constantly adapt and finetune the choreography
to accommodate Chingay’s evolving artistic vision. Le Bon's remarkable
journey culminated in his nomination as the school's valedictorian, a testament
to his all-round achievements and the impact he has made on his school
community. His story is truly inspiring, demonstrating how the application
of adaptability and resilience helped him overcome all odds.</p>
