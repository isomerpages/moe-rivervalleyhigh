<p>Our campus at Seng Poh Road (1956–1957)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in 1956, River Valley High School (RVHS) was the first Chinese
secondary school set up by the government. The school, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initially
known as the Singapore Government Chinese Middle School, first occupied
the premises of Seng Poh Primary School before being renamed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queenstown
Government Chinese Middle School upon its move to Strathmore Avenue. In
1958, it was relocated to Jalan Kuala and renamed River Valley Government
Chinese Middle School. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The year 1968 proved pivotal for RVHS, marked by then Prime Minister Mr
Lee Kuan Yew’s visit to the school – a momentous occasion in its history.
The school’s expanded facilities were officially opened, reflecting its
growth and development. The establishment of the first School Advisory
Committee (SAC), led by Mr Ang Hai Phor, further strengthened the school’s
governance framework and laid the groundwork for sustained support in the
years ahead.</p>
<p><strong>A Journey of Growth and Transformation (1971–1990)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1979 was a landmark year when RVHS was granted Special Assistance Plan
(SAP) status, recognising the school’s commitment to bilingual and bicultural
education. In that same year, under the leadership of Mr Harold Soh Eng
Meng, the Alumni was established, creating a formal network to connect
former students with their alma mater.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1980, the school underwent another significant change with its official
renaming to River Valley High School, heralding a new chapter in its history.
The establishment of the first Students’ Council that year demonstrated
the school’s dedication to nurturing student leadership and fostering an
inclusive environment, with students’ voices being integral to the decision-making
process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>December 1986 saw RVHS relocate to a new campus at West Coast Road with
the school’s expansion. On 1 January 1987, the then Minister of State for
Education, Mr Tang Guan Seng, flagged off a 16-kilometre walk from the
old campus at Jalan Kuala to the new premises at West Coast Road. The formal
opening of the new campus was officiated by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, then Member
of Parliament for Ayer Rajah, on 14 January 1989. To preserve the school’s
rich heritage, the RVHS Archives was completed and officially opened by
Mr Lee Tuan Tuan, then Assistant Treasurer of the SAC, and then SAC member,
Dr Ho Nai Kiong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our West Coast campus (1987–2004)</p>
<p>These milestones collectively represented a period of significant growth
and transformation for RVHS, laying the foundation for the school’s continuing
role in nurturing future generations of students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Scaling New Heights (1991–2009)</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RVHS entered another exciting phase of growth in the early 1990s. The
school welcomed its 35<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 1991 with celebrations
including a dinner on school grounds and a vibrant concert at Kallang Theatre
that brought the community together. In 1993, RVHS transitioned to a single-session
school. In 1994, RVHS was selected as one of six autonomous schools in
Singapore, affirming its educational excellence. In 1996, RVHS commemorated
its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary with a cultural concert at the World Trade
Centre and a dinner hosted by the alumni.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The early 2000s saw RVHS take bold steps in technology and learning. In
2000, RVHS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pioneered the Fast Track @ Schools
project, championing Infocomm Technology education, and also became the
West 3 Centre of Learning for Science and Technology. In 2001, RVHS launched
the Distinguished Speakers Series and Science Niche Programme, while celebrating
its 45<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year. Despite facing challenges
like the SARS outbreak in 2003, the school achieved new heights – its Chinese
Orchestra performed at the Esplanade Theatre and RVHS was selected to pioneer
the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BackPack.NET</a> programme,
bringing new technology into the classroom. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BackPack.NET</a> programme
was launched by then Minister for Education, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,
at RVHS. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mid-2000s saw RVHS unite its community in an ambitious drive towards
transformation. The school organised walks, golf tournaments, and celebration
dinners to raise funds for its development. During that period, RVHS moved
twice – first to Queensway, then to Malan Road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Malan Road campus (2006–2009)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2005 saw another milestone for RVHS when the school was chosen to offer
the Integrated Programme (IP). In 2006, RVHS celebrated its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary
at the National University of Singapore (NUS), while starting its new IP
journey. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>RVHS also became the West Zone’s Centre of Excellence for Science and
Technology (2007) and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;began &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offering
the Bicultural Studies Programme (2007). By 2008, its last batch of O-Level
students graduated and the school was fully running the IP with 1,600 students.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Forging a New Era of Limitless Possibilities (2010–Present)</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>RVHS’s journey from 2010 to the present bears testimony to its continuous
pursuit of growth and limitless possibilities as the school pushes the
boundaries of educational excellence and inspires our students to become
Leaders of Distinction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The early 2010s marked significant transitions for RVHS. The school established
its permanent home at 6 Boon Lay Avenue in 2010, while simultaneously launching
the Asian Young Leaders Convention that brought together 900 student leaders
from across Asia. The following year &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marked
RVHS's 55<sup>th</sup> anniversary and saw its first batch of IP students
excel in the GCE A-Level examination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Student leadership and the arts gained stronger foothold in RVHS in the
2010s. In 2013, the school started two new programmes – the Y.LEAD Seminar
and River Valley Model United Nations (RVMUN). The school held its first
Arts Fest week in 2014 at the NUS, where performing arts students showcased
their artistic talents. That year, the Students' Council created the iconic
music video “立化情” which beautifully exemplifies the school’s spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The period from 2015 to 2017 was characterised by academic innovation
and infrastructural enhancement. The school built a new School Arch in
2015 and launched the Humanities and Social Sciences Leaders Academy (HSSLA).
During its 60<sup>th</sup> birthday celebrations in 2016, RVHS launched
two more academies –&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Mathematics Leaders Academy
(MLA) and the Pedagogical Excellence Academy (PEA) for teaching excellence.
In 2017, the school opened its &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurial
Hub, which included new spaces for a Digital Media Hub, Fabrication Laboratory,
and Entrepreneurial space. These facilities supported the school's flagship
Construct, Integrate, Differentiate (CID) programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2019, the school welcomed its first group of Joint Admissions Exercise
(JAE) students, opening its doors to even more students from diverse backgrounds,
and celebrated its 65<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, RVHS continues to grow from strength to strength, building on its
past successes and achieving greater heights. The school enjoys strong
partnerships with stakeholders like the SAC, Alumni and Parent-Teacher
Association, offering diverse and rich local and global learning opportunities
for students. In 2023, RVHS refined its vision to <strong><em>“Leaders of Distinction for Singapore”</em></strong>,
reflecting its unwavering commitment to placing students at the heart of
education and underscoring the school’s dedication to developing future-ready
thinkers, leaders, and achievers who not only seek to develop themselves
holistically, but are also keen to contribute meaningfully to Singapore
and beyond. This updated focus accentuates the importance of developing
RVians’ 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies alongside the emphasis on student
learning, character development, and well-being.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
