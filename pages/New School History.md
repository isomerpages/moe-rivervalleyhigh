<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our campus at Seng Poh Road (1956-1957)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in 1956, River Valley High School (RVHS) was the first Chinese
secondary school set up by the government. The school, initially known
as the Singapore Government Chinese Middle School, first occupied the premises
of Seng Poh Primary School before being , renamed Queenstown Government
Chinese Middle School upon its move<s>d</s> to Strathmore Avenue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1958, it was relocated to Jalan Kuala and renamed River Valley Government
Chinese Middle School.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The year 1968 proved pivotal for RVHS, marked by then Prime Minister Mr
Lee Kuan Yew’s visit to the school – a momentous occasion, in its history.
During this period, the school’s expanded facilities were officially opened,
reflecting its growth and development. The establishment of the first School
Advisory Committee, led by Mr Ang Hai Phor, further strengthened the school’s
governance framework and laid the groundwork for sustained support in the
years ahead.</p>
