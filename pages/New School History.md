<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our campus at Seng Poh Road (1956-1957)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in 1956, River Valley High School (RVHS) was the first Chinese
secondary school set up by the government. The school, initially known
as the Singapore Government Chinese Middle School, first occupied the premises
of Seng Poh Primary School before being , renamed Queenstown Government
Chinese Middle School upon its move<s>d</s> to Strathmore Avenue.</p>
<p>In 1958, it was relocated to Jalan Kuala and renamed River Valley Government
Chinese Middle School. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The year 1968 proved pivotal for RVHS, marked by then Prime Minister Mr
Lee Kuan Yew’s visit to the school – a momentous occasion, in its history.
During this period, the school’s expanded facilities were officially opened,
reflecting its growth and development. The establishment of the first School
Advisory Committee, led by Mr Ang Hai Phor, further strengthened the school’s
governance framework and laid the groundwork for sustained support in the
years ahead.</p>
<p><strong>A Journey of Growth and Transformation (1971-1990)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1979 &nbsp;marked a landmark year when RVHS was granted Special Assistance
Plan (SAP) status, recognising the school’s commitment to bilingual and
bicultural education. That same year, under the leadership of Mr Harold
Soh Eng Meng, the School Alumni was established, creating a formal network
to connect former students with their alma mater.</p>
<p>In 1980, &nbsp;the school underwent another significant change with its&nbsp;official
renaming to River Valley High School, heralding a new chapter in its history.
The establishment of the first Student Council during this year demonstrated
the school’s dedication to nurturing student leadership and fostering an
inclusive environment where students’ voices become integral to the decision-making
process.</p>
<p>December 1986 saw&nbsp;RVHS relocate to a new campus at West Coast Road,
symbolising the school’s expansion. On 1 January 1987, the then Minister
of State for Education, Mr Tang Guan Seng, flagged off a 16-kilometre walk
from the old campus at Jalan Kuala to the new&nbsp;premises at West Coast
Road.&nbsp;The formal opening of the new campus was officiated by Dr Tan
Cheng Bock, then MP for Ayer Rajah,&nbsp;&nbsp;on 14 January 1989. To preserve
the school’s rich heritage, the RVHS Archives was completed and officially
opened by Mr Lee Tuan, Assistant Treasurer of the School Advisory Committee
(SAC), and SAC member Dr Ho Nai Kiong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
