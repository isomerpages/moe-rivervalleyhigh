<p>During the E&amp;C Week, our auditorium came alive with the timeless melodies
and vibrant storytelling of Huangmei Opera. Students from Secondary 1 were
treated to a captivating performance of “Three Fights with the White Bone
Demon” — a classic scene from Journey to the West. Our students not only
watched a live opera, but also got to take part in fun, interactive sessions!
From wielding the horse whip and golden hoop stick to a lively game of
“Teachers Act, Students Guess”, RVians explored the charm and artistry
of traditional Chinese culture. We are proud to commend Wu Yee Ho (2C)
for writing an article about this programme in Zaobao Schools. Check it
out!</p>
