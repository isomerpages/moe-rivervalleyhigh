## H3 Programme (JC2)

#### BACKGROUND

*   The 2006 ‘A’ level curriculum introduced a set of programmes at Higher 3 (H3) level to cater to the learning interests of the top 10% to 15% of the ‘A’ level cohort who have exceptional interest and aptitude in a particular subject. The intention is to provide them with opportunities to pursue their passions and stretch themselves.
*   The H3 programme builds on the knowledge and skills taught at Higher 2 (H2) level but in a more specialised area. Students who wish to offer a programme at H3 level would have to offer the corresponding subject at H2 level. With this approach, students would acquire the foundational knowledge needed for an H3 programme.

#### MOE-CAMBRIDGE AND MOE PARTNER H3 PROGRAMMES

*   Table 1 below shows the MOE-CAMBRIDGE and MOE Partner H3 programmes in River Valley High School that are available for student application.
*   The MOE-CAMBRIDGE H3 programme provides students with diverse learning opportunities for in-depth study. The syllabus of a H3 subject offered at 'A' level can be found online at the following URL: [https://www.seab.gov.sg](https://www.seab.gov.sg)
*   The H3 programmes offered by MOE Partners (such as NUS, NTU and SMU) may take the modes of an extended research essay or a university-taught course.
