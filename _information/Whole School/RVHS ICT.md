## RVHS ICT

The intent of ICT in RVHS is to&nbsp;_**integrate technology into our 21st century learning environment to nurture thinkers, leaders and achievers with global perspectives.**_

The RVHS ICT experience aims to nurture future ready Singaporeans and equip students with 21st Century Competencies. We hope that students will become self-directed and collaborative learners, critical thinkers and be designers of their own learning through new pedagogies presented by ICT.

The benefit of using ICT is that it allows for anytime, anywhere learning, connected to others and to access information for Self-directed and Collaborative Learning whenever required. Through the use of technology, students are also able to choose the type of digital product to construct in demonstrating their understanding.

#### National Digital Literacy Programme&nbsp; (NDLP)

The PLD initiative under NDLP is a nation wide MOE initiative to equip every Secondary school student with a Personal Learning Device to make digital learning inclusive&nbsp; and develop digital literacies to be future ready.

The&nbsp;**objectives**&nbsp;for PLD initiative are:

**The Personal Learning Device**<br>
Using a 3 As approach (Affordability, Applicability and Appropriateness), RVHS had subscribed to Windows device as the school wide PLD for NDLP. In 2021, the Lenovo L13 was chosen, however, due to global shortages, Lenovo L13 supply is not able to meet the PLD initiative demand for schools in Singapore. Thus, for 2022, Acer Travelmate P2 (P3 pending) is the PLD choice.&nbsp;

All secondary school students will either be purchasing from PLD initiative bulk ordering or to use a self purchased personal laptop of similar specifications with Device Management Application installed.

Parents of 2022 Secondary 1 intake are advised not to purchase any digital device and wait for the announcement for the PLD initiative PLD bulk order. Should there be an urgent need for digital device, parents can consider purchasing a Windows based second hand device. Students can also request for a PLD loan.

**PLD Specifications**<br>
The specification of the subscribed PLDs are as follows:

**Warranty and Insurance**  

RVHS had subscribed to the Enhance Device Bundle with extended warranty and insurance for the PLD. All claims will be arrange through the PLD contractor.&nbsp;Click&nbsp;[here](/files/Insurance%20and%20warranty.pdf)&nbsp;for the details of the coverages.

**Device Management Application (DMA)**<br>
DMA is a critical component for PDLP and all laptops must be installed with DMA in order to be used in school for learning as a PLD. It is necessary for monitoring of PLD activities and inculcate good cyberwellness habits without the presence of constant policing.

The DMA serves 3 purposes:

| Device Management Service | Classroom Management Service | Usage Management Service |
|---|---|---|
| This facilitates the updating and management of the PLDs and&nbsp; protects from malicious software and objectionable internet content. | Enables teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and learning. | Enables the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for your child’s/ward’s use of PLD after school. |
|  |  |  |

Click [here](/files/Function%20of%20DMA.pdf) for details of DMA features.<br>
Click [here](/files/Privacy%20and%20Data%20Security.pdf) for details of the data that will be monitored by the DMA.

The DMA will enforce a school prescribed settings during school hours from 0700 to 1500 during school days. For after school hours, weekends and holidays, DMA settings will follow that of parents choice.  

Parents can have the option to choose DMA settings for after school hours,, weekends and holidays. There are 3 options to choose from:

| Default Setting | Option A: Modified Setting | Option B: Disabled |
|---|---|---|
| PLD to follow school prescribed settings | Parents can modify DMA settings after school hours | Parents can disable the DMA settings after school hours |
|  |  |  |

Click [here](/files/DMA%20Settings%20After%20School%20Hours.pdf) for details on the DMA settings options.<br>
To note: DMA system is undergoing stabilisation by DMA MOE team, thus, after school hours for short school holidays (ie &lt; 7 days) will still follow that of normal school days.

Link to the FormSG to&nbsp;**option for the DMA settings**&nbsp;will be made available for parents through Parents Gateway notification. You may also contact any of the DMA administrators should you have any issues with locating the DMA option form.&nbsp;  

Parents can request to change your choice of After-School DMA Options at any time through the same link. However, please note that changes to the After-School DMA Options will only take effect at the end of every month.

#### Bring Your Own Mobile Device (BYOMD)

Smart mobile phones continue to be an integral part of the 21st Century Learning environment in RVHS as it serve the primary communication needs for students learning. The portability of the smart mobile device complemented the primary PLD in situation and environment which the primary PLD may not be too suitable. Eg outfield investigation, filming and image capturing.

#### Computing Device for JC students

As PDLP is not extended to JC level, students are encouraged to acquire a personal laptop of any type and kind to better tackle the requirement of computing usage for higher order learning should they not have one. (Hybrid laptop is preferred for better integration between work productivity )

*   JC students can continue to use smart mobile phones for personalised anytime, anywhere learning.
*   Needy students can apply for subsidised purchase of laptops through NeuPlus programme and also through school FAS scheme.
*   Needy students may also loan out laptops for personalised learning. Request for loans are subjected to approval and may require recall if needed for upgrades or audits.

#### Cyber Wellness @ RV

To emphasize the proper learning usage of computing devices in River Valley High School, iPads and other computing devices are referred to as Personal Learning Devices (PLDs). A series of measures are put in place to inculcate and to remind students of responsible usage.

**Cyber Wellness theme in CCE lessons**<br>
Cyber Wellness is an area that is heavily themed in the new CCE lessons where students are placed in discourse on contemporary topics to build identity and belonging. Students are made aware of Cyber Wellness issues and the potential&nbsp; impacts through these discussions in class.&nbsp;

**PLD Usage Guidelines**<br>
The PLD usage guidelines builds upon MOE's R3ICH core values and details how PLD should be use in school.

<img src="/images/PLD Guidelines Posters.png" style="width:85%">

**Acceptable Usage Policy**<br>
The Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) is an agreement made by the students to adhere to the guidelines for proper PLD usage. There are 2 parts to the AUP - the first part is between the student and the school; the second part is between the student and the parent. The parent-student AUP requires the parent and the student to work out a mutual agreement on what constitutes to acceptable usage of PLD at home. The parent-student AUP is a dynamic agreement and will need to be revised as the student grows. Often than not, the AUP serve as a 'conversation starter' between the student and the parent of PLD usage at home.

AUP is available for download [here](/files/AUP%20EL%20&amp;%20CL.pdf).
