<h2>RVHS ICT</h2>
<p>The intent of ICT in RVHS is to&nbsp;<strong><em>integrate technology into our 21st century learning environment to nurture thinkers, leaders and achievers with global perspectives.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The RVHS ICT experience aims to nurture future ready Singaporeans and
equip students with 21st Century Competencies. We hope that students will
become self-directed and collaborative learners, critical thinkers and
be designers of their own learning through new pedagogies presented by
ICT.</p>
<p>The benefit of using ICT is that it allows for anytime, anywhere learning,
connected to others and to access information for Self-directed and Collaborative
Learning whenever required. Through the use of technology, students are
also able to choose the type of digital product to construct in demonstrating
their understanding.</p>
<h4>National Digital Literacy Programme&nbsp; (NDLP)</h4>
<p>The PLD initiative under NDLP is a nation wide MOE initiative to equip
every Secondary school student with a Personal Learning Device to make
digital learning inclusive&nbsp; and develop digital literacies to be future
ready.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>objectives</strong>&nbsp;for PLD initiative are:</p>

<p><strong>The Personal Learning Device</strong>
<br>Using a 3 As approach (Affordability, Applicability and Appropriateness),
RVHS had subscribed to Windows device as the school wide PLD for NDLP.
All secondary school students will either be purchasing from PLD initiative
bulk ordering or to use a self purchased personal laptop of similar specifications
with Device Management Application installed.</p>
<p>Parents of new Secondary 1 intake are advised not to purchase any digital
device and wait for the announcement for the PLD initiative PLD bulk order.
Should there be an urgent need for digital device, students can request
for a PLD loan from school's ICT helpdesk</p>
<p><strong>Warranty and Insurance</strong>
</p>
<p>RVHS had subscribed to the Enhance Device Bundle with extended warranty
and insurance for the PLD. All claims will be arrange through the PLD contractor.</p>

<p><strong>Device Management Application (DMA)</strong>
<br>DMA is a critical component for PDLP and all laptops must be installed
with DMA in order to be used in school for learning as a PLD. It is necessary
for monitoring of PLD activities and inculcate good cyberwellness habits
without the presence of constant policing.</p>
<p>The DMA serves 3 purposes:</p>

<h4>Bring Your Own Mobile Device (BYOMD)</h4>
<p>Smart mobile phones continue to be an integral part of the 21st Century
Learning environment in RVHS as it serve the primary communication needs
for students learning. The portability of the smart mobile device complemented
the primary PLD in situation and environment which the primary PLD may
not be too suitable. Eg outfield investigation, filming and image capturing.</p>
<h4>Computing Device for JC students</h4>
<p>As PDLP is not extended to JC level, students are encouraged to acquire
a personal laptop of any type and kind to better tackle the requirement
of computing usage for higher order learning should they not have one.
(Hybrid laptop is preferred for better integration between work productivity
)</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>JC students can continue to use smart mobile phones for personalised anytime,
anywhere learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Needy students can apply for subsidised purchase of laptops through NeuPlus
programme and also through school FAS scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Needy students may also loan out laptops for personalised learning. Request
for loans are subjected to approval and may require recall if needed for
upgrades or audits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cyber Wellness @ RV</h4>
<p>To emphasize the proper learning usage of computing devices in River Valley
High School, iPads and other computing devices are referred to as Personal
Learning Devices (PLDs). A series of measures are put in place to inculcate
and to remind students of responsible usage.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness theme in CCE lessons</strong>
<br>Cyber Wellness is an area that is heavily themed in the new CCE lessons
where students are placed in discourse on contemporary topics to build
identity and belonging. Students are made aware of Cyber Wellness issues
and the potential&nbsp; impacts through these discussions in class.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PLD Usage Guidelines</strong>
<br>The PLD usage guidelines builds upon MOE's R3ICH core values and details
how PLD should be use in school.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:85%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/PLD Guidelines Posters.png">
</div>
<p><strong>Acceptable Usage Policy</strong>
<br>The Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) is an agreement made by the students
to adhere to the guidelines for proper PLD usage. There are 2 parts to
the AUP - the first part is between the student and the school; the second
part is between the student and the parent. The parent-student AUP requires
the parent and the student to work out a mutual agreement on what constitutes
to acceptable usage of PLD at home. The parent-student AUP is a dynamic
agreement and will need to be revised as the student grows. Often than
not, the AUP serve as a 'conversation starter' between the student and
the parent of PLD usage at home.</p>
<p>AUP is available for download <a href="/files/AUP%20EL%20&amp;%20CL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
