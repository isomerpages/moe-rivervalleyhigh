<p>MOE introduced the Edusave Character Award (EChA) to enable schools to
recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding
personal qualities through their behaviour and actions. MOEâ€™s objective
is to send a clear and strong signal that character and values development
are on par with achievements in the academic domain. It also serves to
recognise in each school, outstanding students with exceptionally good
character and can be role models to inspire others.&nbsp;</p>
