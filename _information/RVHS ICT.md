## RVHS ICT

The intent of ICT in RVHS is to _**integrate technology into our 21st century learning environment to nurture thinkers, leaders and achievers with global perspectives.**_

The RVHS ICT experience aims to nurture future ready Singaporeans and equip students with 21st Century Competencies. We hope that students will become self-directed and collaborative learners, critical thinkers and be designers of their own learning through new pedagogies presented by ICT.

The benefit of using ICT is that it allows for anytime, anywhere learning, connected to others and to access information for Self-directed and Collaborative Learning whenever required. Through the use of technology, students are also able to choose the type of digital product to construct in demonstrating their understanding.

#### National Digital Literacy Programme  (NDLP)

The PLD initiative under NDLP is a nation wide MOE initiative to equip every Secondary school student with a Personal Learning Device to make digital learning inclusive  and develop digital literacies to be future ready.

The **objectives** for PLD initiative are:

**The Personal Learning Device**<br>
Using a 3 As approach (Affordability, Applicability and Appropriateness), RVHS had subscribed to Windows device as the school wide PLD for NDLP. In 2021, the Lenovo L13 was chosen, however, due to global shortages, Lenovo L13 supply is not able to meet the PLD initiative demand for schools in Singapore. Thus, for 2022, Acer Travelmate P2 (P3 pending) is the PLD choice. 

All secondary school students will either be purchasing from PLD initiative bulk ordering or to use a self purchased personal laptop of similar specifications with Device Management Application installed.

Parents of 2022 Secondary 1 intake are advised not to purchase any digital device and wait for the announcement for the PLD initiative PLD bulk order. Should there be an urgent need for digital device, parents can consider purchasing a Windows based second hand device. Students can also request for a PLD loan.

**PLD Specifications**<br>
The specification of the subscribed PLDs are as follows:
