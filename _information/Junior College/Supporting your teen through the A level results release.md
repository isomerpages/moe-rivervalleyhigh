<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>The 2024 A-Level results will be released soon. Regardless of the outcome,
it is important for our teens to know that they are loved for the person
that they have grown up to be, and that their grades do not define who
they are in our eyes.</p>
<p>The support you offer your teen during this milestone is especially necessary
and valuable in helping your teen manage emotions and be positive when
deciding on next steps.</p>
