</p>
<p>The Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) recognizes the importance of parents’
participation on the learning journey of their teens.&nbsp; You can find
out more about the PTA <a href="https://rivervalleyhigh.moe.edu.sg/about-rv/school-partners/parent-teacher-association" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Personal Device for Learning Programme (PDLP)</strong></h4>
<p>MOE had announced that every secondary student will need to have a personal
digital device for the purpose of learning.</p>
<p>Parents are advised not to purchase digital device at the moment and wait
for the announcement for the PDLP offer. Should there be an urgent need
for a digital device, parents can consider purchasing a Windows based secondhand
device.&nbsp; Otherwise, the student can also loan out a laptop from the
school (subject to availability).</p>
<h4><strong>Appeal for School Transfer (Primary 6 Students)</strong></h4>
<p>Primary 6 students who have applied to River Valley High School (RVHS)
during MOE’s Secondary 1 Posting Exercise but are unsuccessful, may appeal
to be considered for transfer to RVHS. These students appealing for admission
to RVHS after the release of the Secondary 1 Posting result have to meet
the school’s cut-off points (COP).</p>
<p>Note that students admitted to a school through the DSA-Sec Exercise will
not be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE
results. They are expected to honour the commitment to the posted DSA school
for the duration of the programme admitted to.</p>
<p>The appeal application period is from the <strong><u>20 to 27 December 2024, 1700hours.</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Late or incomplete appeal will not be considered.</p>
<p>Application is to be done strictly via this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/2025rvhssec1appeal" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">form</a>.</p>
<p>For your convenience, it is not necessary to submit any hardcopy appeal
form personally.&nbsp; Students who are successful in their appeals will
need to provide us with the actual documents which they have used to support
their appeal for checking purpose when school re-opens.</p>
<p><strong>Pending the outcome of appeal, all applicants are required to report to the school that they are posted to by the Ministry of Education on Secondary 1 Registration Day.</strong>
</p>
<p>Successful applicants will be informed by 30 December 2024.</p>
<p>The decision of the school’s Admissions Committee is final, and the school
will not enter into discussion with the applicants regarding its decision.</p>
<p>For further information, please contact the General Office at Tel: 65678115
during office hours</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
