#### DSA enquiries on Performing Arts CCAs

|  |  |
|---|---|
| Would you be lowering your DSA criteria as there is no SYF or any other competitions? | Students should display a strong aptitude in the talent area they applied for. Auditions and interviews will be conducted to assess their suitability in that talent area. |
| If my child has learnt only ballet and modern dance, and not other dance forms, and has been in the dance team but quit ballet in P6 due to the heavy workload, can she still apply for dance DSA and does she need to be the key dancer in her CCA? | Yes, having ballet or any dance skills would be an advantage, thus she does not need to be the key dancer. In RV Dance society, our dancers learn **both Chinese and modern contemporary dance**. All dancers would have to learn both genres, they cannot choose which genre they want to learn. |
| My child is in Hip Hop in primary school, can my child apply for DSA dance? | Yes, having any dance skills would be an advantage but please note that in RV Dance society, the dancers do not take hip hop or street dance at the secondary level. Street Dance CCA is offered at the JC levels. |
| How is the assessment for dance conducted? | There will be an audition for dance candidates. |
| What competencies are you looking for in a student applying for Concert Band or Chinese Orchestra? Is there a particular instrument you will give preference to for DSA? For example, is the CCA short of certain instrument players so more priority will be given to these students? | The school will assess a student’s musicality, which is the ability to perceive and reproduce differences in the [aspects of music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspects_of_music) including pitch, rhythm, and harmony. Basically, it is the ability to be able to reproduce music in addition to creating music (musical creativity).<br><br>At the application phase, past achievements, competition involvement and academic requirements will be taken into consideration for short-listing.<br><br>For Chinese Orchestra, the school will consider all musical instruments excluding guzheng and violin.<br><br>For Concert Band, the school will consider all musical instruments excluding piano and violin. |
| If my child has public speaking experience, should he/she apply for English Language Debate or English Drama?<br><br>What competencies are you looking for when it comes to debates? <br><br>If my child gets accepted for Drama through DSA, does it mean he/she has to do drama as a subject in RV? | It depends on your child’s interest and talents/competencies.<br><br>Both CCAs require your child to have a strong command of the language, confidence in public speaking, passion for the language and the ability to analyse facts and present spontaneously.<br><br>Your child has to take up Drama as his/her CCA if he/she accepts the offer to come into RV via Drama. |
| If my child wants to apply for English Debates via DSA, does he/she need to be in the school debate team to be qualified? Some primary schools do not have debates as a CCA but if the child has participated in debate training outside school, can my child apply? | If the primary school does not have a debate team but your child has debate training or participated in debate competitions, and wishes to pursue his/her passion, please go ahead and apply for it. |

#### DSA Enquiries on Other Talent Areas

| How do we apply for DSA leadership?<br><br>Must the child hold a key position in the school prefectorial board or CCA? | Your child’s primary school CCA record should reflect that he/she holds a key position in the school prefectorial board as one of the office bearers (for example, EXCO member). For Girl Guides, she should be conferred the Chief Commissioner's Badge as it is the highest achievement at the primary school level.<br><br>We believe in the leadership potential of all students and there are many opportunities to develop their potential.<br><br>For DSA leadership, we are specifically looking for a greater leadership capacity. Being in a key leadership position is a signal that the student has been recognised to have the capacity to be stretched and developed, hence chosen, among their peers whom they work together, to be the representative of the prefectorial board. |
| What will be required of the child if she is accepted through DSA leadership or girl guides? | Upon entering RV, your child will be in our Student Leadership Development Academy and Students' Council. For Girl Guides, your child will continue her Girl Guides journey with us in RVHS. |

| Are the GCE A-Level subjects taught in-house in RVHS? | As an Integrated Programme school, our students go through a seamless 6-year educational journey, hence the GCE A-Level curriculum is taught in RV. |
| How does RV perform in the GCE A-Level Examinations? | RV students have been performing above the national average in the GCE A-Level Examinations and the school has been consistently value-adding to the students’ A-Level performance. In addition, 1 in 3 students get a scholarship, something that we are immensely proud of, considering that our students do not take the O-Levels. This shows the dedication and support of our teachers to ensure that our students do well in the examinations. Many students get scholarships to study at prestigious universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial college, London School of Economics, UC Berkeley, Harvard, Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan and other renowned universities. |
| If my child is not able to cope with the Integrated Programme after the 1st year, what other options are there for my child?<br><br>What is the drop-out rate?| As a school, we provide our fullest support to our students. This environment comprises the form teachers, subject teachers and Year Master, and they monitor students' progress and decide on a remediation programme to help students when necessary. Coupled with strong home-school partnership, we are confident of helping our students to do well in the GCE A Level Examinations. Students who asked to leave RV typically do so because they want to pursue a course that is not offered in the A Level curriculum.<br><br>Note: DSA students are not eligible to transfer to other secondary or IP schools after acceptance of the Confirmed Offer. |

This will enable them to pursue a different track offered at the polytechnic.<br><br>Note: DSA students are not eligible for any transfer to other secondary or IP schools after acceptance of the Confirmed Offer. |
| Does RV place more emphasis on the Chinese Language than on English Language? | As a SAP school, we strongly believe in the importance of both languages, given the global landscape that demands proficiency in both languages and bicultural sensitivity in order for us to engage with the rest of the world. By placing equal emphasis on both languages, our students will have a competitive edge when they graduate as they can be the bridge between the East and the West. |
| Is there any promotion criteria from Sec 1 to J2? | Just like any other school, there is a set of promotion criteria that students need to meet in order to be promoted to the next level. |
| Does my child need to take Higher Chinese Language in P5 and 6 in order to be admitted into RV? | There is no need to as long as your child takes our RV Chinese Language Programme. |
| What is the Chinese Language Programme like in RV? | As an SAP and IP school, we have a specially designed RV Chinese Language programme for all students. This programme aims to build their foundation and equip them with the necessary skills and competencies so that they are well prepared to sit for the GCE O-Level Higher Chinese Language Examination in secondary 4. |
| Does RV offer any other mother tongue languages? | We offer other mother tongue languages to our JC students only. |
| Can a student participate in more than one of the six Talent Academies? | We do not limit students' capacity and interest. With the right aptitude, membership in more than one Academy is possible and encouraged. |

| Is there any support for students who struggle with the Chinese Language? | Yes, we have after-school programmes to support the students’ learning of the Chinese Language. In addition, our school has various enrichment programmes to ignite their love for the language. |
| If my child takes the Art Elective Programme in another school, can my child take fewer subjects in RV? | No, your child will still be taking the same core subjects as the rest so that they can keep their options open when it comes to choosing their subject combination in Secondary 3. |
| If my child takes Higher Chinese Language in primary school, does he or she have priority for admission into RV? | Students who obtain Distinction, Merit or Pass in HCL and have a PSLE score of 14 or better (i.e. PSLE score ≤ 14) will be eligible for posting advantage when applying to SAP schools. If multiple students with the same PSLE score apply for the same SAP school, those with better HCL grades will be allocated a place ahead of other students. This applies before the tie-breakers. |
