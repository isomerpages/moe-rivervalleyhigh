			<td><br><br><br>How do we apply for DSA leadership?<br><br>Must the child hold a key position in the school prefectorial board or CCA?</td>
			<td>Your child’s primary school CCA record should reflect that he/she holds a key position in the school prefectorial board as one of the office bearers (for example, EXCO member).

Being in a key leadership position is a signal that the student has been recognised to have the capacity to be stretched and developed, hence chosen, among their peers whom they work together, to be the representative of the prefectorial board.</td>
