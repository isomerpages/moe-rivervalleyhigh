| **Questions** | **Answers** |
|---|---|
| What is the DSA exercise timeline like? | It is usually from mid-May to early September. The exact timeline for this year is not available yet. Please check our website for updates after MOE releases its announcement on the DSA Exercise. |

| What documents do I need to submit together with the application form? | Please refer to the instructions for the relevant application platform. You may attach relevant documents (eg. certificates of achievement) which illustrate the level of competence in the selected talent area. |
| How do we show our achievements when there were no National School Games or SYF last year? | MOE will be extracting students' CCA records from their primary school. We are still able to assess the child's interest and potential from the available records. We will also assess the child’s talents during the trials or auditions. |
| When will I know if I have been shortlisted for the test / audition / trial / interview? | All applicants will be informed if they have been shortlisted and will be provided with the details from end June. |
| When will I know if I have been offered a place? | All shortlisted applicants will be notified of the outcome of their applications in August. |
| I received more than one DSA offer. When must I decide which to accept? | You will have to indicate your preferences in ranked order for up to three schools during the Exercise School Preference Stage. |
| What is the minimum AL score needed to be shortlisted for DSA trial / audition?<br><br>Does RV only accept DSA students with AL1 in all subjects? | The DSA scheme provides students with an alternative route to gain admission to RVHS. All applicants will be assessed for their talents during the trials or auditions, and ability to cope with the IP curriculum based on their P5 and P6 results. |
| Must my child obtain a good grade for Chinese Language so as to be considered for shortlisting? | As a SAP school that believes in bilingualism, we will assess your child’s ability to cope with our RVIP Chinese Language Programme in the shortlisting process based on the results provided in the application. |
| Does my child need to take Higher Chinese Language in primary school in order to apply for a place in RV? | Higher Chinese Language (HCL) is not a prerequisite for admission to RVHS. |
| Must my child’s PSLE Achievement Level Score fall within a specific range even if he receives a Confirmed Offer from your school? | Your child must qualify for the Express stream. |
| Where can I find the list of CCAs for DSA? | The new DSA CCA list will be put up after MOE’s release of DSA information. |
| Is there a DSA quota for each CCA or on the whole? | There is no fixed quota. The objective of DSA is to identify talent, taking into consideration the student’s interest and long term development potential. |
| Are there CCAs which are more popular and see a higher number of DSA applicants? | No, there is no discernible trend. |
| If my child gets in through DSA, must my child join the CCA for 6 years? What if his interest changes? | Yes, your child must remain in the same CCA so that we can develop his/her full potential over six years. <br><br>If choice of CCA is important, then your child should avoid applying for entry via DSA as there are conditions attached. |
| For students admitted via DSA, do they have more training / practice sessions than the others? | No, for sports, they will train thrice a week and for the performing arts, they will train twice a week, just like the rest of their team. |
| Would my daughter be at a disadvantage during the DSA exercise if she is not a Singaporean? | Your child’s nationality does not matter in the DSA exercise. Our assessment is based on talents and ability to cope with the rigour of an IP school. |
