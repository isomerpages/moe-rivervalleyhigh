We are proud of our 424 students who sat for the 2022 GCE A-Level Examination for their outstanding performance, not just academically but also exemplifying our school’s values and spirit. 64 students achieved at least 6 distinctions, and about 1 in 3 students achieved at least three H2 distinctions. 35 students scored a full University Admissions Scores (UAS) of 90 rank points and around 3 in 5 students scored more than 80 rank points.

The school would like to thank and acknowledge everyone who has contributed to the success of our graduates. They include our School Leaders, staff who have taught or assisted the students, School Advisory Committee, Alumni, Parent-Teacher Association, and parents/guardians of all RVHS graduates.

We celebrate the holistic development and achievements of our students. The following seven students are amongst many who have made a positive impact on the school community and beyond.
