and finance at a polytechnic in 2021. However, when she realised that she
had a deep-seated passion for STEM subjects and problem-solving, she decided
to switch to the A-Level route. Taking the JC route was no easy feat for
Jessie as she could not recall some of the math and science concepts that
she had studied in secondary school after spending a year in polytechnic.
Things took a positive turn when Jessie’s dedicated subject tutors encouraged
her and gave her additional help after learning about her academic concerns.
This, coupled with supportive schoolmates who readily shared their knowledge
and explained the concepts that she grappled with, allowed her to gradually
find the academic rigour to be an enjoyable challenge. Jessie’s academic
journey has been a remarkable one and her story is a testament to the power
of determination and the extraordinary heights one can reach with sheer
courage and grit. (You can watch the media interview with her here: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.8world.com/singapore/a-level-results-2382201</a>)</p>
