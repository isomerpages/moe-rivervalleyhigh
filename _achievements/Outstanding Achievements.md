<p>Goh Jun Yu (Class of 2023) was awarded the Lee Hsien Loong Award for Outstanding
Bicultural Students at the MOE Special Awards Ceremony. This award recognises
outstanding students in the Bicultural Studies Programme, underpinning
the strategic importance of developing bicultural students who harness
global perspectives.</p>
<p>In a separate competition, Jun Yu won the third prize for the MAS-Economic
Society of Singapore (ESS) essay competition. What is amazing about this
is that he did not take A-Level Economics when he was in JC but he was
able to apply what he had learnt from other disciplines to write an essay
on the impact of global industrial policies on Singapore's economy.</p>
