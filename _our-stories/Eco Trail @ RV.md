<p>In 2023, the school transformed and refreshed the existing Eco-garden
between the classroom blocks into an exciting and vibrant green learning
space – the Eco-Trail @ RV, which officially opened on 16 Jan 2024 during
our school's 68th Anniversary. The Eco-Trail forms part of the Outdoor
Agri-Sustainability Innovation Space (OASIS) in the school campus to support
our Eco Stewardship Programme, which promotes sustainable living and empowers
students to play their part for the environment.</p>

<p>Comprising four main zones – the Fruit Tree Garden, the Ornamental Ponds,
the Wetland Zone and the Rainforest Zone, the Eco-Trail is our green resource
to make teaching and learning of sustainability more authentic and meaningful
for our students. It also aims to draw attention to issues of climate change,
food and water security while inculcating in students a love for nature
and biodiversity with its close to 100 species of flora. The thriving ecosystems
have attracted wildlife, such as bats, frogs, kingfishers and monitor lizards
to the school. Teachers have also created outdoor lessons at the Eco-Trail
to raise students’ awareness of, and commitment to sustainability – nurturing
them to become environmental stewards for life.</p>
