<p>Composed in 2013,&nbsp;<strong>立化情</strong>&nbsp;is a song written by
    Neo Ling Wei Nicholine (Class of 2013) to welcome the new batch of Year
    1 freshmen into the RV family. The 35th Student Council decided to leverage
    on this heartfelt song and came up with the music video production with
    the intention of bonding the RV family, for the alumni to reminisce the
    memories we had in RV, and for RVians, past and present, to be proud to
    be an RVian.</p>
<p>立化情 tells the RV story, an experience unique to RVians. From the perspective
    of one who was about to complete her journey in RV, reminiscence flows;
    the friendships forged, memories written and the times spent with fellow
    peers, things close to our hearts, are common for all yet unique to each
    individual.</p>
<p>Through this, we hope to build a stronger sense of pride for the school,
    for all generations of RVians to treasure the friendships forged, our memories
    and the times that we have spent in RV, 似水流年用难忘，地久天长立化情.</p>
<h4>立化情&nbsp;♦ 作词作曲：梁伶蔚</h4>
<p>回想一起度过的时光
    <br>梦想飞翔
    <br>成长在立化的土壤
    <br>创造了希望
    <br>求学之道并不容易
    <br>一起努力
    <br>因为有了你
    <br>创造美好回忆
    <br>
    <br>在立化我不孤单
    <br>酸甜苦辣朋友陪伴
    <br>立化情是那么地灿烂
    <br>在未来记忆相伴
    <br>在立化我不孤单
    <br>酸甜苦辣朋友陪伴
    <br>立化情是那么地灿烂
    <br>就在未来记忆相伴
    <br>
    <br>如今追逐各自的理想
    <br>不再迷茫
    <br>未来的路就在前方
    <br>不害怕 不紧张
    <br>感怀那些年的努力
    <br>庆幸有你
    <br>与我同悲喜
    <br>让我充满勇气
    <br>
    <br>在立化我不孤单
    <br>酸甜苦辣朋友陪伴
    <br>立化情是那么地灿烂
    <br>在未来记忆相伴
    <br>从立化我们扬帆
    <br>草木青青海云缦缦
    <br>立化情是那么地温暖
    <br>这份友情千金不换</p>

<p>As River Valley High School prepared to celebrate her 60th&nbsp;birthday,
    a group of young men and women decided to celebrate&nbsp;their fond memories
    of the school with a song. Titled '青春彼岸' (Qing&nbsp;Chun Bi An), the song
    was an expression of gratitude to the school as&nbsp;well as a wistful
    glance at the carefree days of being an RVian in years&nbsp;gone by.</p>
<p>It all started with a string of Alumni events, from an anniversary&nbsp;&nbsp;dinner
    in November 2014 to a mass sing-a-long session in April&nbsp;&nbsp;2015,
    which allowed us to gather a group of local musical talents&nbsp;&nbsp;who
    were RV Alumni. The teacher representative (Mr Yeo Chengrong) then&nbsp;&nbsp;suggested
    that the group could produce an original song together.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    song could build on RV’s foundation as a pioneer of the xinyao&nbsp;&nbsp;movement
    in Singapore, and it would be an appropriate present to&nbsp;&nbsp;the
    school during its 60th anniversary. That idea quickly took hold&nbsp;&nbsp;and
    before long, the prototype was produced in December 2015&nbsp;&nbsp;with
    the combined song-writing talent of Regine Han and Bevlyn&nbsp;&nbsp;Khoo.
    A choir of singers was assembled – Regine Han, Bevlyn Khoo,&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiu
    Jian, Edric Hsu, Tay Sia Yeun and Yeo Chengrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the RV60&nbsp;&nbsp;celebration dinner, young alumnus Nicholine
    Neo served as guitarist&nbsp;&nbsp;and current student, Cai Yu Han was
    the keyboardist. It was indeed an&nbsp;&nbsp;apt reflection of the RV spirit
    of '携手共进' , and a salutation to strong&nbsp;&nbsp;bonds forged across batches
    of RVians, drawing much applause&nbsp;&nbsp;and cheers from the guests
    that included past principals, teachers&nbsp;&nbsp;and students along with
    the guest-of-honour, Acting Minister for&nbsp;&nbsp;Education (Schools)
    Mr Ng Chee Meng.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'青春彼岸' indeed captures the essence of the RV spirit, an&nbsp;&nbsp;enduring
    quality that has distinguished the school for the last 60&nbsp;years!</p>
