<p>The school is committed to providing our students with a holistic education
and we develop each child to his/her fullest in the intellectual, social,
moral, emotional, physical and aesthetic domains. This is done through
our Balanced Education Curriculum (BEC), which comprises the&nbsp;Cognitive-Interest
Development Curriculum&nbsp;(CIDC), the&nbsp;Leadership-Character Development
Curriculum&nbsp;(LCDC) and the Civic Literacy and Global Awareness Development
Programme (CGDP).</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>CIDC</strong>&nbsp;nurtures good habits of mind, critical thinking
skills and knowledge construction, as well as prepares students for university
admission. It is designed based on the ASK (Attitudes, Skills and Knowledge)
learning culture and implemented with the TfU (Teaching for Understanding)
Framework from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LCDC</strong>: We believe in nurturing leaders of distinction
who possess good character to serve the community and nation. We place
students at the heart of all our efforts in student development, catering
to their developmental needs and their social-emotional well-being, as
we nurture their character growth and develop them into morally upright
individuals, and responsible and active citizens. When designing learning
experiences, we seek to understand our students’ needs and interests and
focus on student engagement and student voice. In this way, we aim to empower
them to take ownership and derive personal meaning from their learning
experiences.
<br>As a Special Assistance Plan school, RVHS places a strong emphasis on
values such as respect, appreciation, gratitude and contribution to society.
RVians demonstrate personal, team, and thought leadership while placing
people at the heart of what they do and serving with empathy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CGDP</strong>&nbsp;focuses on developing students’ civic-mindedness
and global perspective. The main components of the CGDC programme are the
Construct, Integrate, Differentiate (CID) programme, Appreciation of Chinese
Culture (ACC) programme and the six academies.</p>
