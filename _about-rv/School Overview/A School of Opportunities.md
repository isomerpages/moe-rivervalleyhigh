<p>The school is committed to providing our students with a holistic education
and we develop each child to his/her fullest in the intellectual, social,
moral, emotional, physical and aesthetic domains. This is done through
our Balanced Education Curriculum (BEC), which comprises the&nbsp;Cognitive-Interest
Development Curriculum&nbsp;(CIDC), the&nbsp;Leadership-Character Development
Curriculum&nbsp;(LCDC) and the Civic Literacy and Global Awareness Development
Curriculum (CGDC).</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>CIDC</strong>&nbsp;nurtures good habits of mind, critical thinking
skills and knowledge construction, as well as prepares students for university
admission. It is designed based on the ASK (Attitudes, Skills and Knowledge)
learning culture and implemented with the TfU (Teaching for Understanding)
Framework from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LCDC</strong>&nbsp;seeks to provide Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) for students. Through components like the Overseas Experiential
Learning Programme (OELP), Enhanced National Education (NE) and Values
in Action (VIA) Programme and platforms such as the Y.LEAD Seminar, LCDC
aims to nurture students who practice values-based citizenship and leadership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CGDC</strong>&nbsp;focuses on developing students’ civic-mindedness
and global perspective. The main components of the CGDC programme are the
Construct, Integrate, Differentiate (CID) programme, Appreciation of Chinese
Culture (ACC) programme and the six academies.</p>
