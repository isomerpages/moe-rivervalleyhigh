## A School of Opportunities


The school is committed to providing our students with a holistic education and we develop each child to his/her fullest in the intellectual, social, moral, emotional, physical and aesthetic domains. This is done through our Balanced Education Curriculum (BEC), which comprises the&nbsp;Cognitive-Interest Development Curriculum&nbsp;(CIDC), the&nbsp;Leadership-Character Development Curriculum&nbsp;(LCDC) and the Civic Literacy and Global Awareness **Programme Curriculum (CGDC). **
*   **CIDC**&nbsp;nurtures good habits of mind, critical thinking skills and knowledge construction, as well as prepares students for university admission. It is designed based on the ASK (Attitudes, Skills and Knowledge) learning culture and implemented with the TfU (Teaching for Understanding) Framework from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
*   **LCDC**&nbsp;seeks to provide Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) for students. Through components like the Overseas Experiential Learning Programme (OELP), Enhanced National Education (NE) and Values in Action (VIA) Programme and platforms such as the Y.LEAD Seminar, LCDC aims to nurture students who practise values-based citizenship and leadership.
*   **CGDC**&nbsp;focuses on developing students’ civic-mindedness and global perspective. The main components of the CGDC programme are the Construct, Integrate, Differentiate (CID) programme, Appreciation of Chinese Culture (ACC) programme and the six academies.
