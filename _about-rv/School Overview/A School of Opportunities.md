<p>The school is committed to providing our students with a holistic education
and we develop each child to his/her fullest in the intellectual, social,
moral, emotional, physical and aesthetic domains. This is done through
our Balanced Education Curriculum (BEC), which comprises the&nbsp;Cognitive-Interest
Development Curriculum&nbsp;(CIDC), the&nbsp;Leadership-Character Development
Curriculum&nbsp;(LCDC) and the Civic Literacy and Global Awareness Development
Programme (CGDP).</p>

<p><strong>CIDC: </strong>River Valley High School’s Cognitive-Interest Development
Curriculum (CIDC) seeks to develop students holistically and equip all
of them with important “Attitude, Skills and Knowledge” (ASK) through authentic
learning experiences.
<br>
<br>Students have the opportunity to develop good habits of mind and dispositions
through a curriculum that fosters a culture of thinking. Students acquire
critical, adaptive and inventive thinking skills that are crucial in the
21st Century, moving progressively from being a novice thinker to an advanced
thinker. At the same time, students engage in learning experiences that
empower them to actively contribute to the community and the nation, nurturing
their civic, global and cross-cultural literacy. In an increasingly digital
world, they are also guided to communicate, collaborate and manage information
thoughtfully and responsibly.
<br>
<br>In addition, students learn not just to acquire knowledge, but to also
construct knowledge. In constructing knowledge, students must show a thoughtful
understanding of the connections and relationships between various disciplines.
They must also show an ability to apply their learning to address problems
that they are likely to encounter in life beyond the classroom.
<br>
<br>RVHS adopts the Teaching for Understanding (TfU) curriculum framework
from the Harvard Graduate School of Education to implement the CIDC.

<p><strong>LCDC: </strong>We believe in nurturing leaders of distinction
who possess good character to serve the community and nation. We place
students at the heart of all our efforts in student development, catering
to their developmental needs and their social-emotional well-being, as
we nurture their character growth and develop them into morally upright
individuals, and responsible and active citizens. When designing learning
experiences, we seek to understand our students’ needs and interests and
focus on student engagement and student voice. In this way, we aim to empower
them to take ownership and derive personal meaning from their learning
experiences.
<br>
<br>As a Special Assistance Plan school, RVHS places a strong emphasis on
values such as respect, appreciation, gratitude and contribution to society.
RVians demonstrate personal, team, and thought leadership while placing
people at the heart of what they do and serving with empathy.</p>

Scholars Programme, Overseas Experiential Learning Programmes and talent
trips.</p>
