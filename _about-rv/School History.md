<p><strong>The Founding Years (1956-1970)</strong>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our campus at Seng Poh Road (1956-1957)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in 1956, River Valley High School (RVHS) was the first Chinese
secondary school set up by the government. The school, initially known
as the Singapore Government Chinese Middle School, first occupied the premises
of Seng Poh Primary School before being , renamed Queenstown Government
Chinese Middle School upon its move<s>d</s> to Strathmore Avenue.</p>
<p>In 1958, it was relocated to Jalan Kuala and renamed River Valley Government
Chinese Middle School. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The year 1968 proved pivotal for RVHS, marked by then Prime Minister Mr
Lee Kuan Yew’s visit to the school – a momentous occasion, in its history.
During this period, the school’s expanded facilities were officially opened,
reflecting its growth and development. The establishment of the first School
Advisory Committee, led by Mr Ang Hai Phor, further strengthened the school’s
governance framework and laid the groundwork for sustained support in the
years ahead.</p>
<p><strong>A Journey of Growth and Transformation (1971-1990)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1979 &nbsp;marked a landmark year when RVHS was granted Special Assistance
Plan (SAP) status, recognising the school’s commitment to bilingual and
bicultural education. That same year, under the leadership of Mr Harold
Soh Eng Meng, the School Alumni was established, creating a formal network
to connect former students with their alma mater.</p>
<p>In 1980, &nbsp;the school underwent another significant change with its&nbsp;official
renaming to River Valley High School, heralding a new chapter in its history.
The establishment of the first Student Council during this year demonstrated
the school’s dedication to nurturing student leadership and fostering an
inclusive environment where students’ voices become integral to the decision-making
process.</p>
<p>December 1986 saw&nbsp;RVHS relocate to a new campus at West Coast Road,
symbolising the school’s expansion. On 1 January 1987, the then Minister
of State for Education, Mr Tang Guan Seng, flagged off a 16-kilometre walk
from the old campus at Jalan Kuala to the new&nbsp;premises at West Coast
Road.&nbsp;The formal opening of the new campus was officiated by Dr Tan
Cheng Bock, then MP for Ayer Rajah,&nbsp;&nbsp;on 14 January 1989. To preserve
the school’s rich heritage, the RVHS Archives was completed and officially
opened by Mr Lee Tuan, Assistant Treasurer of the School Advisory Committee
(SAC), and SAC member Dr Ho Nai Kiong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our West Coast campus (1987 to 2004)</p>
<p>These milestones collectively represented a period of significant growth
and transformation for RVHS, laying the foundation for the school’s continuing
role in nurturing future generations of students.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling New Heights (1991-2009)</strong> 
<br>RVHS entered another exciting phase of growth in the early 1990s. The
school welcomed its 35<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 1991 with celebrations
that brought the community together – &nbsp;a dinner on school grounds
and a vibrant concert at Kallang Theatre. In 1993, RVHS transitioned to
a single-session school. In 1994, RVHS was selected as one of six autonomous
schools in Singapore, affirming its educational excellence. In 1996, RVHS
commemorated its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary with a cultural concert at
the World Trade Centre and a dinner hosted by the alumni. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The early 2000s saw RVHS take bold steps in technology and learning. In
2000, RVHS pioneered&nbsp;the Fast Track @ Schools project, championing
Infocomm Technology education, and also became&nbsp;the West 3 Centre of
Learning for Science and Technology. In 2001, RVHS launched the Distinguished
Speakers Series and Science Niche Programme, while celebrating its 45th
year. Despite facing challenges like the SARS outbreak in 2003, the school
achieved new heights – its Chinese Orchestra performed at the Esplanade
Theatre&nbsp;and RVHS was selected to pioneer the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BackPack.NET</a> programme, bringing
new technology into classrooms. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BackPack.NET</a> programme
was launched by then-Minister for Education, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,
at RVHS.</p>
<p>The mid-2000s saw RVHS unite its community in an ambitious drive towards
transformation. The school organised walks, golf tournaments, and celebration
dinners to raise funds for its development. During this time, RVHS moved
twice – first to Queensway, then to Malan Road.</p>

<p>Malan Road (2006 To 2009)</p>
<p>A major breakthrough came in 2005 when the school was chosen to offer
the Integrated Programme. In 2006, RVHS celebrated its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary
at NUS, while starting its new Integrated Programme journey. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final years of this period saw RVHS become the West Zone’s Centre
of Excellence for Science and Technology (2007) and began offering its
Bicultural Studies Programme (2007). By 2008, its last batch of O-Level
students graduated&nbsp;and the school was running a complete Integrated
Programme with 1,600 students. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pursuing Limitless Possibilities (2010 – Present)</strong>
</p>
<p>RVHS’s journey from 2010 to the present exemplifies its pursuit of limitless
possibilities as the school continues to push the boundaries of educational
excellence and inspire our students to become Leaders of Distinction. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The early 2010s marked significant transitions for RVHS. The school established
its permanent home at 6 Boon Lay Avenue in 2010, while simultaneously launching&nbsp;the
Asian Young Leaders Convention that brought together 900 student leaders
from across Asia. The following year marked RVHS's 55th anniversary and
saw its first batch of Integrated Programme students excel&nbsp;in the
GCE A-Level Examination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mid-2010s focused on strengthening student leadership and the arts.
In 2013, the school started two new programmes – the &nbsp;Y.LEAD Seminar
and River Valley Model United Nations (RVMUN). The school held its first
Arts Fest week in 2014 at NUS, where performing arts students showcased
their artistic talents. &nbsp;That year, the Students' Council created
the iconic music video called '立化情'&nbsp;that captured the school’s spirit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The period from 2015 to 2017 was characterised by academic innovation
and infrastructure enhancement. The school built a new School Arch in 2015
and launched the Humanities and Social Sciences Leaders Academy (HSSLA).
During its 60<sup>th</sup> birthday celebrations in 2016, RVHS launched
two more academies –&nbsp;the Mathematics Leaders Academy (MLA) and the
Pedagogical Excellence Academy (PEA) for teaching excellence. &nbsp;In
2017, the school opened its Entrepreneurial Hub, which included new spaces
for a Digital Media Hub, Fabrication Laboratory, and Entrepreneurial space.
These facilities supported the school's flagship programme - Construct,
Integrate, Differentiate (CID).</p>
<p>In 2019, the school welcomed its first group of JAE students, opening
its doors to more students from diverse backgrounds, and celebrated its
65<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations in 2021.</p>
<p>Today, the school continues to grow from strength to strength. In 2023,
RVHS refined its vision to <strong><em>“Leaders of Distinction for Singapore”</em></strong>,
reflecting its unwavering commitment to putting students at the heart of
education. This renewed focus emphasises the development of 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies alongside student learning, character development, and well-being.
The vision underscores RVHS’s dedication to nurturing future-ready thinkers,
leaders and achievers who possess the head, heart and will to contribute
meaningfully to Singapore and the world.&nbsp;</p>
