<p>Welcome to the River Valley High School family, where every student's
journey is one of discovery, growth and purpose.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2026 marks a significant milestone for River Valley High School as we
celebrate RV’s 70<sup>th</sup> School Anniversary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At RV, we believe that true education touches the heart as much as it
sharpens the mind. We are committed to nurturing Leaders of Distinction—young
people of good character, bicultural understanding, and global vision who
will become the thinkers, leaders and achievers our nation needs. Our school
motto, "Upholding Virtues, Contributing to Society"(立德立功 化愚化顽), reflects
a timeless commitment that has guided generations of RVians: to honour
tradition whilst shaping destinies and leaving lasting legacies for Singapore
and beyond.</p>
<p>This vision comes alive through the values we hold dear. We inspire our
students to pursue excellence, not for accolades alone, but to discover
and fulfil their unique potential. We build perseverance, helping them
find strength in adversity and courage in uncertainty. We nurture people-centricity,
teaching them that the greatest leaders serve with empathy and place others
at the heart of their actions. We also cultivate proactiveness, empowering
them to be the positive change makers deeply rooted in their commitment
to nation and community.</p>
<p>The RV spirit—lifelong learning, humility, innovation, gratitude, and
collaborative progress—shapes through&nbsp;every classroom, every activity,
every interaction. It is this spirit that has inspired countless RVians
to pursue their passions courageously, lead with integrity, and touch lives
in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>As we celebrate our 70th anniversary in 2026, we honour the legacy of
those who came before us whilst looking forward with hope and determination.
Every student who walks through our gates can add their own chapter to
the RV story—to honour our rich traditions, shape their own destiny, and
leave a legacy that will inspire future generations.</p>
<p>Together with you, our parents and community partners, we will continue
this proud tradition of nurturing Leaders of Distinction who will serve
Singapore and the world with excellence, compassion and purpose.</p>
<p>Welcome to River Valley High School. Your story begins here.</p>
<p>欢迎来到立化大家庭。在这里，每一位立化学子将开启一段探索未知、发现自我、成就志向的成长旅程。</p>
<p>2026年是立化中学的一个重要里程碑，我们将迎来70周年校庆。在立化，我们深信教育之本，在于启迪智慧，更在于润泽心灵，成就健全的人格。我们致力于培养杰出的领袖——他们不仅拥有正直善良的品格、双语双文化底蕴和国际视野，更将成为引领时代，为国家贡献的中流砥柱。&nbsp;</p>
<p>我校校训“立德立功，化愚化顽”体现了指引历代立化人的永恒承诺：在承传薪火的同时，开拓前程，为新加坡及世界留下深远的贡献。&nbsp;</p>
<p>这一愿景通过我校的核心价值得以实现。我们激励学生追求卓越，不仅是为了荣誉，更是为了发掘并实现个人潜能；我们磨练毅力，让他们在逆境中寻找力量，在未知的挑战中展现勇气；我们秉持以人为本的精神，教导学生以同理心服务社会；我们培养积极进取的态度，赋能学子成为扎根家国、敢于担当的变革者。&nbsp;</p>
<p>好学不倦、谦恭自信、创新求异、感恩立德及携手共进——这些立化精神的基因，已然深植于课堂内外，潜移默化地浸润在每一项活动与每一次交流之中。正是这种精神，感召着无数立化人勇往直前地追求热忱，恪守诚信地履行领导重任，并以非凡的行为温暖人心、回馈社会。&nbsp;</p>
<p>在迎接70周年校庆之际，我们感恩先贤坚毅不拔的创校精神，更以满怀的希望与决心开创未来。每一位走进立化校门的学子，都在续写立化的故事——承传优良传统，塑造个人前程，并留下激励后辈的珍贵足迹。&nbsp;</p>
<p>我们将与家长及社区伙伴携手并进，继续履行育人使命，培养追求卓越、心怀仁爱、志向远大的杰出领袖，为新加坡及世界贡献力量。&nbsp;</p>
