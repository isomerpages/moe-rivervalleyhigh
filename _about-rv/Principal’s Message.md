<p>Welcome to the River Valley High School family, where every student's
journey is one of discovery, growth and purpose.</p>
<p>2026 marks a significant milestone for River Valley High School as we
celebrate RV’s 70<sup>th</sup> School Anniversary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At RV, we believe that true education touches the heart as much as it
sharpens the mind. We are committed to nurturing Leaders of Distinction—young
people of good character, bicultural understanding, and global vision who
will become the thinkers, leaders and achievers our nation needs. Our school
motto, "Upholding Virtues, Contributing to Society"(立德立功 化愚化顽), reflects
a timeless commitment that has guided generations of RVians: to honour
tradition whilst shaping destinies and leaving lasting legacies for Singapore
and beyond.</p>
<p>This vision comes alive through the values we hold dear. We inspire our
students to pursue excellence, not for accolades alone, but to discover
and fulfil their unique potential. We build perseverance, helping them
find strength in adversity and courage in uncertainty. We nurture people-centricity,
teaching them that the greatest leaders serve with empathy and place others
at the heart of their actions. We also cultivate proactiveness, empowering
them to be the positive change makers deeply rooted in their commitment
to nation and community.</p>
<p>The RV spirit—lifelong learning, humility, innovation, gratitude, and
collaborative progress—shapes though&nbsp;every classroom, every activity,
every interaction. It is this spirit that has inspired countless RVians
to pursue their passions courageously, lead with integrity, and touch lives
in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>As we celebrate our 70th anniversary in 2026, we honour the legacy of
those who came before us whilst looking forward with hope and determination.
Every student who walks through our gates can add their own chapter to
the RV story—to honour our rich traditions, shape their own destiny, and
leave a legacy that will inspire future generations.</p>
<p>Together with you, our parents and community partners, we will continue
this proud tradition of nurturing Leaders of Distinction who will serve
Singapore and the world with excellence, compassion and purpose.</p>
<p>Welcome to River Valley High School. Your story begins here.</p>
