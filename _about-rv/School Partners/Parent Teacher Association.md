<h2>Parent-Teacher Association</h2>
<p><strong>Philosophy</strong>
</p>
<p>The PTA recognises the importance of parents’ participation on the learning
journey of their teens. We believe we can complement and enhance the roles
of parents in the following ways:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong>&nbsp;– The PTA serves as a networking platform
for parents to provide mutual support while connecting with the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enrichment</strong>&nbsp;– The PTA is also a platform for parents
to improve their parenting skills so they can better understand and support
their teens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;– The PTA supports the school in providing
RVians with a holistic education.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Parents in Education (PiE)</h4>

to help them better support the education and development of their children.
It contains articles on parenting tips, educational news, information on
the school curriculum, and resources for parents to support their children’s
