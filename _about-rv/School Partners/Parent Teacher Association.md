## Parent-Teacher Association

**Philosophy**

The PTA recognises the importance of parents’ participation on the learning journey of their teens. We believe we can complement and enhance the roles of parents in the following ways:

*   **Engagement**&nbsp;– The PTA serves as a networking platform for parents to provide mutual support while connecting with the school.
*   **Enrichment**&nbsp;– The PTA is also a platform for parents to improve their parenting skills so they can better understand and support their teens.
*   **Support**&nbsp;– The PTA supports the school in providing RVians with a holistic education.

**Key Activities**

*   **Engagement**&nbsp;– Membership 3-Step Awareness Programme, Annual General Meeting, EXCO Meetings, Members Gatherings and Parent-Teen Bonding Activities.
*   **Enrichment**&nbsp;- Parenting Talks and Workshops, High Achievers and EL &amp; CL Sharing Session.
*   **Support**&nbsp;– RV Healthy Lifestyle Month, Sports Carnival, Teachers’ Day, Supper for Year 6 Night Study Programme.

#### Parents in Education (PiE)
