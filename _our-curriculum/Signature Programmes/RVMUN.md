<h2>What is RVMUN?</h2>
<p>With over 300 delegates signing up every year, RVMUN is a beginner-friendly
Model United Nations (MUN) where delegates debate about pressing global
affairs, and through the process, be equipped with the knowledge and skills
to be able to understand and address the intricacies and complexities of
the world. RVMUN aims to provide delegates with the essential and critical
insight into global issues, and foster a sense of responsibility and integrity
in addressing and finding solutions to these challenges.</p>

<h3><strong>RVMUN 2026</strong></h3>
<h4>OUR THEME</h4>
<p>
<br>For our 14th iteration this year, our theme is "Verbis Creare", or "to
Create with Words". Through this theme, we hope to remind delegates that
their words hold great meaning. The conveying of ideas through speeches
and negotiations becomes a tool for the creation of ideas, solutions, and
partnerships. “Verbis Creare” celebrates the transformative potential of
effective communication and encourages participants to harness diplomacy
not just as debate, but as constructive dialogue that shapes a better world.</p>
<p>Aligned with the mission of Model United Nations, this theme emphasises
that the most profound global progress begins not with force, but with
conversation. It invites delegates to use their voices as instruments of
collaboration, to speak not just to be heard, but to build.</p>
