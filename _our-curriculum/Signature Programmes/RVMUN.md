<h2>What is RVMUN?</h2>
<p>With over 300 delegates signing up every year, RVMUN is a beginner-friendly
Model United Nations (MUN) where delegates debate about pressing global
affairs, and through the process, be equipped with the knowledge and skills
to be able to understand and address the intricacies and complexities of
the world. RVMUN aims to provide delegates with the essential and critical
insight into global issues, and foster a sense of responsibility and integrity
in addressing and finding solutions to these challenges.</p>
