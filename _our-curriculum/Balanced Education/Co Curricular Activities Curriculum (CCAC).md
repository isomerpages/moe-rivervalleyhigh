<h4><strong>Co-Curricular Activities</strong></h4>
<p>The Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) curriculum fosters strong moral character,
values-based leadership and active citizenry in students. CCA is a key
Student Development Experience that nurtures leadership, character, social-emotional
competencies, citizenship dispositions and 21st Century Competencies. Students
are allocated CCAs based on their talents and interests.

<h4><strong>CCA Engagement Guidelines</strong></h4>
<p>1. Secondary 1 to 4 Integrated Programme (IP) students are required to
participate in at least one core CCA offered by the school. IP students
are strongly encouraged to opt for the same CCA in their Junior College
(JC) years for holistic longer-term development.</p>
<p>2. JC students are highly encouraged to engage in at least one CCA and
are encouraged to stay in the same CCA for two years.</p>
<p>3. Students may choose to have a second CCA only if they are able to cope
with the academic demands.</p>
<p>4. JC students may initiate suitable Interest Development Programme (IDP).
All IDPs are subjected to approval from the HOD PE/CCA.</p>
