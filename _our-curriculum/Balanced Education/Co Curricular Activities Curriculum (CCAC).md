<h4><strong>Co-Curricular Activities</strong></h4>
<p>The Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) curriculum fosters strong moral character,
values-based leadership and active citizenry in students. CCA is a key
Student Development Experience that nurtures leadership, character, social-emotional
competencies, citizenship dispositions and 21st Century Competencies. Students
are allocated CCAs based on their talents and interests.
