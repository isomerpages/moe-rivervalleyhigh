## The Humanities and Social Sciences Leaders Academy

Throughout the course of history, the humanities have served to enrich and inform society, and provide the context in which policy and technological innovations can advance meaningfully. In addition, the humanities and social sciences also have an important role to play in the development of critical and independent thinking as learned minds grapple with changing contexts, shifting viewpoints and intricate philosophies. As RVHS sets out to instil 21st century competencies in promising young adults, the Humanities and Social Sciences Leaders Academy (HSSLA) was conceived to cater to students who have a passion to pursue further studies in the Humanities at the tertiary level. HSSLA talents are aligned to ‘Leaders, Scholars, Humanists’, young adults who are well-poised to take on future challenges and opportunities.

Through various platforms, HSSLA students gain insights in the multi-faceted field of the Humanities and are exposed to issues that are pertinent to the human condition. As a critical mass of perceptive and passionate learners from across a multitude of subjects under the umbrella of the humanities and social sciences, students build on one another’s views, opinions and generate their own unique perspective of the world.  
  
The programmes organised by the HSSLA include seminars and a speaker series where participants acquire a multi-disciplinary perspective on issues surrounding the hyper-globalisation of modernity. Collaborations with external agencies, complemented by both local and overseas experiential learning journeys, talks and conferences with academics from institutions of higher learning provide additional platforms for HSSLA students to be the best that RVHS can offer humanity.
