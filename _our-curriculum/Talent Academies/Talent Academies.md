In RV, our students are groomed for success. Our signature Grow, Excel, Magnify (GEM) Talent Development Framework progressively identifies a variety of talents in all our students and customises multiple programmes and platforms to nurture and **Grow** those talents over six or two years. Students are given the change to **Excel** through talent development programmes designed by RV's academic departments. In addition, outstanding students can further **Magnify** their talents and skills through challenging programmes and projects to make a significant impact on communities around them.
