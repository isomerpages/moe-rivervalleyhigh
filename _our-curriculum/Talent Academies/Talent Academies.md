In RV, our students are groomed for success. Our signature Grow, Excel, Magnify (GEM) Talent Development Framework progressively identifies a variety of talents in all our students and customises multiple programmes and platforms to nurture and **Grow** those talents over six or two years. Students are given the change to **Excel** through talent development programmes designed by RV's academic departments. In addition, outstanding students can further **Magnify** their talents and skills through challenging programmes and projects to make a significant impact on communities around them.  
  
RV's talent academies consist of

*   [Science Leaders Academy](/our-curriculum/Talent-Academies/sla/)
*   [The Eco-Sustainability Leadership Academy](/our-curriculum/Talent-Academies/tesla/)
*   [Mathematics Leaders Academy](/our-curriculum/Talent-Academies/mla/)
*   [Bicultural Leaders Academy  双文化学研中心](/our-curriculum/Talent-Academies/biculturalldra/)
*   [The Humanities and Social Sciences Leaders Academy](/our-curriculum/Talent-Academies/hssla/)

With such strong support for talent development, RVians continue to produce leaders of distinction in various local and international competitions and events.
