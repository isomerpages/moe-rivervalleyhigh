In RV, our students are groomed for success. Our signature&nbsp;**Grow, Excel, Magnify (GEM)**&nbsp;Talent Development Framework progressively identifies a variety of talents in all our students and customises multiple programmes and platforms to nurture and&nbsp;**Grow**&nbsp;those talents over six years. Students are given the chance to&nbsp;**Excel**&nbsp;through talent development programmes designed by RV’s academic departments. In addition, outstanding students can further&nbsp;**Magnify**&nbsp;their talents and skills through challenging programmes and projects to make a significant impact on communities around them.

RV’s talent academies consist of the&nbsp;**Science Leaders Academy**,&nbsp;**The Eco-Sustainability Leaders Academy**,&nbsp;**Mathematics Leaders Academy**,&nbsp;**Bicultural Leaders Academy**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**The Humanities and Social Sciences Leaders Academy**. With such strong support for talent development, RVians continue to produce leaders of distinction in various local and international competitions and events.
