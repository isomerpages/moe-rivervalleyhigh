<h2>Eco-Sustainability Leadership Academy</h2>
<p>Established in 2015, The Eco-Sustainability Leadership Academy (TESLA)
envisions its members to become knowledge leaders and proactive advocates
who inspire actions in eco-sustainability. Through student-led initiatives
that range from&nbsp; resource management to biodiversity conservation,
TESLA develops leaders with the knowledge about environmental sustainability,
as well as the passion to inspire sustainable practices in both the school
and the community. To broaden the horizons of the members, TESLA provides
opportunities for students for hands-on activities and exploration out
in the real-world. TESLA is also a platform for outreach to the student
body, spreading awareness about pressing environmental issues to involve
the school in addressing them.&nbsp;</p>
