## The Humanities and Social Sciences Leaders Academy

Throughout the course of history, the humanities have served to enrich and inform society, and provide the context in which policy and technological innovations can advance meaningfully. In addition, the humanities and social sciences also have an important role to play in the development of critical and independent thinking as learners grapple with changing contexts, shifting viewpoints and intricate philosophies. 

The Humanities and Social Sciences Leaders Academy (HSSLA) at RVHS was conceived to cater to students who have a passion to pursue further studies in the humanities at the tertiary level. The academy aspires to equip our students with 21st Century Competencies and to become "Thinkers, Leaders, Humanists".

Through various platforms, HSSLA students gain insights in the multi-faceted field of the humanities and learn about issues that are pertinent to the human condition. The academy runs both teacher-led and student-led interdisciplinary modules that explore topics from "What is a humanist?" to ethical considerations in science. Students may also propose to lead a module on a topic of their choice and hone their leadership skills.

In 2023, HSSLA brought a group of students to Ireland and the U.K. for an Overseas Experential Learning Programme (OELP). Through such opportunities, HSSLA hopes to widen the perspectives and increase the cultural capital of our students so that they are ready for the challenges of the future.
