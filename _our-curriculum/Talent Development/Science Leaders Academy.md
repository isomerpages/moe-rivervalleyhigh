## Science Leaders Academy

The Science Leaders Academy (SLA) nurtures creative and innovative leaders in science and technology. It provides learning, research and leadership opportunities for our high ability students who show a strong interest and passion in science, through four programmes:

**(a) Young Scientists @ Work Programme**<br> 
Through internships that are at least three months long, students learn first-hand the work of scientists and experience research at laboratories of tertiary institutions, research institutes and industrial establishments.

**(b) Global Science Village Programme** <br>
This programme provides opportunities for students to see science in practice in different parts of the world. These include learning journeys and international summer school programmes at renowned science institutions and research establishments. Upon their return, students may initiate collaborative research projects with overseas partner schools.  
  
**(c) Science for the Community Programme** <br>
Students solve real-world problems by applying their scientific knowledge and leadership skills in the design, development and implementation of solutions in order to benefit the community.
