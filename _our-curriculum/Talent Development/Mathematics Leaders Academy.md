The Mathematics Leaders Academy (MLA) harnesses the talents of our students, inspires and empowers them through learning, mentorship and leadership opportunities. Guided by the B.u&amp;i.L.D (Broaden.Lead.Deepen) approach for talent development, MLA seeks to nurture our students to be leaders in the field, to develop their passion and deep subject mastery, and to equip them with 21st century competencies.

##### Broad-based Learning
Students’ perspectives are broadened through enrichment workshops conducted in-house or by external speakers, as well as learning journeys designed to enhance their mathematical learning experience. There are also opportunities for student-directed research where students engage in self-initiated learning to explore, discover, construct knowledge and apply their mathematical understanding in areas of their interest. Through purposeful discussions, students engage in mathematical discourse, exchange perspectives and extend their thinking.

Students also have the opportunity to participate in the Overseas Experiential Learning Programme, where they experience interdisciplinary learning by connecting mathematics with other disciplines through real-world applications in areas such as architecture, innovation, technology and engineering. Through cultural immersion and interactions with local students, our students also gain valuable global exposure, broadening their perspectives and developing a deeper appreciation of diverse cultures and viewpoints in an increasingly interconnected
### Deep Subject Mastery

Rigorous training is conducted to equip students with higher-order critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and prepare them for national and international Mathematics competitions. Sec 4 and JC 1 students can also look forward to undertaking a several-month-long research project under the mentorship of academics or researchers from institutes of higher learning or research institutions. In groups, students build their mathematical rigour and intellect, and acquire useful mathematical research skills.

#### Leadership Development

Students have the opportunity to hone their leadership skills through leading, planning and implementing events such as the River Valley Mathematics Challenge, the Mathematics department’s key student-centered event organised for primary school students. MLA further promotes student agency though MyMLA, a leadership platform that empowers students to propose bottom-up initiatives which they are passionate in, to lead and take charge. As students value-create in support of MLA’s objectives, they also find greater purpose as contributing members of the academy.&nbsp;
