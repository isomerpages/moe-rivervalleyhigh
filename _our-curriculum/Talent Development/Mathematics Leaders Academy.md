## Mathematics Leaders Academy

The Mathematics Leaders Academy (MLA) harnesses the talents of our students, inspires and empowers them through learning, mentorship and leadership opportunities. Guided by the B.u&amp;i.L.D (Broaden.Lead.Deepen) approach for talent development, MLA seeks to nurture our students to be leaders in the field, to develop their passion and deep subject mastery, and to equip them with 21st century competencies.  
  
**Broad-based Learning** <br>
Studentsâ€™ perspectives are broadened through enrichment workshops conducted by local university lecturers and teachers, learning journeys and overseas experiential learning programme. There are also opportunities for student-directed research where students explore, discover, construct knowledge and apply their mathematical knowledge through the self-initiated learning component at various levels.

**Deep Subject Mastery** <br>
Rigorous training is conducted to equip students with higher-order critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and prepare them for national and international Mathematics competitions. JC 1 students also undertake a 7-month-long research project under the mentorship of academics or researchers from institutes of higher learning or research institutions. In their groups, students build their mathematical rigour and intellect, and acquire useful mathematical research skills.

**Leadership Development** <br>
Students have the opportunity to hone their leadership skills through leading, planning and implementing events such as the River Valley Mathematics Challenge, the Mathematics department's key student-centered event organised for primary school students.
