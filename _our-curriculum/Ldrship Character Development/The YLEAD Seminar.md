## The Y.LEAD Seminar

Y.LEAD is an acronym for “Youth. Leverage Educate Actuate Develop”. The seminar is a platform for local and international participants aged between 15 and 17 to acquire a heightened awareness of global social challenges, an understanding of values-based leadership and a useful set of leadership skills. The objective of the seminar is to empower youths to become future leaders who can make a positive change to society.

As organisers and hosts of the Y.LEAD Seminar, RVians also gain valuable experience from conceptualising, planning and organising a large-scale international seminar.
