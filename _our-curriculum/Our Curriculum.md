#### RV Integrated Programme

**6-Year Integrated Programme**<br>
As one of the few schools that offer a 6-year Integrated Programme, we customise and design our programme to provide a seamless development of RVians' talent and potential to the fullest.

**Interdisciplinary Applied Learning**<br>
Our Cognitive-Interest Development Curriculum is designed to deepen students’ 21st century competencies and prepare them to overcome challenges with confidence. Our programmes emphasise the application of critical thinking skills across subject disciplines and an acquisition of a broad and deep foundation through applied learning experiences in authentic settings. For instance, in our Construct, Integrate, Differentiate Programme, RVians employ their skills and knowledge across various disciplines to identify and solve real-world problems.  

**All-Round Development**<br>
We place great emphasis on holistic education in RV. Our Integrated Programme focuses on producing leaders of sterling character, developing RVians to their fullest academic potential and nurturing their talent in co-curricular activities.

**Strong Partnerships**<br>
RVians have many invaluable opportunities to be mentored by top researchers and professors in leading institutions, as well as go on immersion programmes in top overseas schools and universities. This gives them an advantage and puts them in good stead to excel in our globalised world.

#### RV Balanced Education Curriculum

RVHS recognises the importance of a holistic education. In order for a student to achieve his full potential and be a leader who contributes to both his family and society, he must not only be strong academically, but must also be guided by the right moral values and have a healthy body and mind.

Thus, RVHS designed and put in place the Balanced Education Curriculum to equip students with knowledge and skills, inculcate the right ethics and moral values, build students’ leadership capabilities, and strengthen students physically.

The Balanced Education Curriculum consists of three domains of development:

*   [Cognitive-Interest Development Curriculum (CIDC)](/our-curriculum/cid/) 
*   [Leadership Character Development Curriculum (LCDC)](https://rivervalleyhigh-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/our-curriculum/leadership-character-development)
*   [Civic Literacy-Global Awareness Development Currciuclum (CGDC)](https://rivervalleyhigh-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/our-curriculum/civic-literacy-and-global-awareness-development)
