<img src="/images/Pt 8.jpeg" style="width:85%">

In RV, our students are groomed for success. Our signature **Grow, Excel, Magnify (GEM)** Talent Development Framework progressively identifies a variety of talents in all our students and customises multiple programmes and platforms to nurture and **Grow** those talents over six years. Students are given the chance to **Excel** through talent development programmes designed by RV’s academic departments. In addition, outstanding students can further **Magnify** their talents and skills through challenging programmes and projects to make a significant impact on communities around them.

RV’s talent academies consist of the **Science Leaders Academy**, **The Eco-Sustainability Leaders Academy**, **Mathematics Leaders Academy**, **Bicultural Leaders Academy** and **The Humanities and Social Sciences Leaders Academy**. With such strong support for talent development, RVians continue to produce leaders of distinction in various local and international competitions and events.
