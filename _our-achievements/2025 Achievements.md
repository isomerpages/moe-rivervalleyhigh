<p>Shen Han's passion for wildlife conservation led him to explore sustainable
food solutions through the MOE Science Mentorship Programme. He helped
researchers at the Singapore University of Technology and Design develop
3D-printed food products with cricket powder as a sustainable alternative,
which later won him first prize at the Shanghai International Youth Science
and Technology Camp.
<br>
</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, Shen Han independently secured research opportunities
at the National University of Singapore. With guidance from Associate Professor
Ryan Chisholm, he conducted literature reviews on endangered bird species
during JC1 GAP Month. After this stint, he worked under Associate Professor
Frank Rheindt, where he proposed a novel colourimetric method to study
avian taxonomy until the end of JC2. His comprehensive report earned first
authorship in an article published in <em>Avian Research</em>, a Gold Award
at the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, and selection as one of
six projects representing Singapore at the International Science and Engineering
Fair in Ohio, USA. He also volunteered with the Worldwide Fund for Nature,
contributing to butterfly counts and habitat impact studies, reflecting
his commitment to conservation. &nbsp;</p>
